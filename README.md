# GitHub Action Workflows

This repository is a collection of workflows used in other Linaro repositories. The purpose of this repository is to act as a definitive source of workflows for common scenarios, particularly building Jekyll static websites.

The workflows typically rely heavily on scripts running on Linaro's actions runner server. Those scripts can be found at <https://github.com/linaro-its/github-action-scripts>.
